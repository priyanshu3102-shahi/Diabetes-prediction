# Diabetes-prediction
## üìä Objective:
In this exercise, we will compare the performance of both the Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models, evaluating which model is more suitable for predicting diabetes based on performance metrics.

| Outcome                      | Target variable indicating if the individual has diabetes (YES/NO).| Categorical |
|                              |                                                                    |             |

### 2. Problem Statement
The goal is to evaluate the performance of both Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models using the same dataset. we will compare the metrics to determine which model performs better.

### 3. Model Evaluation
3.1. Model Comparison

‚Ä¢	Train both Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models on the same training dataset.

3.2. Evaluation Metrics

‚Ä¢	Evaluate each model using:<br>
   o	Accuracy: The overall accuracy of the model.

   o	Precision: The proportion of positive predictions that were correct.

   o	Recall: The proportion of actual positives correctly identified.

   o	Confusion Matrix: Analyze the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for both models.

3.3. Visualization

‚Ä¢	Plot ROC curves to compare the models‚Äô performance.

‚Ä¢	Visualize the confusion matrices to assess classification performance.

### 4. Model Selection
Based on the evaluation metrics, decide which model (Decision Tree or Logistic Regression) performs better for predicting diabetes. Discuss which model you would recommend for this problem and why.
